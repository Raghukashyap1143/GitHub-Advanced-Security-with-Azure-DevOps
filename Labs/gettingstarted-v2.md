# Mitigating Vulnerabilities with GitHub Advanced Security and Azure DevOps
### Overall Estimated Duration: 8 Hours
## Overview
In this hands-on lab, you will build a robust security architecture within Azure DevOps, starting with the setup of the eShopOnWeb team project and configuring advanced security permissions. This foundational setup paves the way for the integration of critical security tools and scanning mechanisms, ensuring a secure development lifecycle from start to finish. 
You will enhance your workflow by integrating GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) with Azure DevOps (ADO), combining the strengths of both platforms to create a more secure and efficient development process. This integration leverages GHAS’s advanced security capabilities and ADO’s powerful DevOps features, providing a unified approach to identifying and mitigating security risks in your codebase.As you continue, you will implement sophisticated code scanning capabilities, starting with basic code analysis and advancing to more complex security layers, represented by the green shield icon. This final stage signifies a fully matured security pipeline, integrating continuous code analysis and vulnerability management to safeguard the entire development process.Throughout the lab, you will work within Azure DevOps to manage security alerts, monitor potential vulnerabilities, and resolve issues in real-time. This comprehensive approach integrates both GitHub Advanced Security and Azure DevOps, creating a seamless security pipeline that proactively identifies and addresses security concerns at every stage of the development lifecycle, ensuring a secure and efficient development environment.

## Objective:
* **Configuring GitHub Advanced Security in Azure DevOps**: Integrate GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) into your Azure DevOps pipeline to bring powerful security features like code scanning, secret detection, and dependency analysis directly into your development workflow. This setup bridges both platforms, enhancing visibility and control over potential security threats early in the software development lifecycle.
* **Secret Scanning**: Implement secret scanning to automatically detect and alert on accidentally committed sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, or tokens. This helps prevent credential leaks and ensures sensitive data is never exposed in your repositories, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
* **Dependency Scanning**: Enable dependency scanning to analyze project dependencies and identify known vulnerabilities in open-source libraries or third-party packages. This ensures your codebase remains secure by alerting you to outdated or vulnerable packages that need to be updated or replaced.
*  **Code Scanning**: Leverage advanced static code analysis to detect security vulnerabilities, coding errors, and potential exploits in your source code. Code scanning helps enforce secure coding practices by integrating automated checks into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring issues are caught and resolved early.
*  **Microsoft Defender for Cloud DevOps Security**: Integrate Microsoft Defender for Cloud with your DevOps environment to gain enhanced visibility into your repositories and pipelines. This provides security insights, compliance tracking, and actionable recommendations, helping you maintain a robust and secure development ecosystem across both GitHub and Azure DevOps.

## Pre-requisites

Participants should have:
* **Familiarity with Azure DevOps**: Understanding of Azure DevOps services, pipelines, and basic security concepts.
* **Experience with Visual Studio**: Working knowledge of Visual Studio 2022 and its security features, particularly around code scanning and dependency analysis.
* **Source Control Knowledge**: Familiarity with Git fundamentals and Azure Repos for managing code repositories.
* **Security Background**: Basic understanding of security principles, vulnerability management, and secure coding practices.

## Architecture
In this hands-on lab, the architecture flow includes several essential security components. You'll begin by setting up the eShopOnWeb team project in Azure DevOps and configuring advanced security permissions to establish the foundational security infrastructure. At the heart of the architecture is the Azure DevOps security scanning system, utilizing both secret scanning and dependency scanning capabilities to identify and manage potential vulnerabilities. These scanning mechanisms enable smooth integration with alert management systems and remediation workflows. The Visual Studio integration plays a crucial role, handling tasks such as dependency scanning, alert analysis, and code fixes, while maintaining security compliance across the development lifecycle.

## Explanation of Components
The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

- **Azure DevOps**: Azure DevOps is a set of development tools and services provided by Microsoft, which offers:
    1. **Azure Repos**: A set of version control tools to manage your code.
    2. **Azure Pipelines**: Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) that works with any language, platform, and cloud.
    3. **Azure Boards**: Agile planning tools to track work with Kanban boards, backlogs, team dashboards, and custom reporting.
    4. **Azure Test Plans**: Automated and manual testing tools.
    5. **Azure Artifacts**: Package management for Maven, npm, NuGet, and more.

## Integrating GitHub Advanced Security with Azure DevOps

Integrating GHAS with ADO can be done through various approaches, combining the security features of GitHub with the powerful development and deployment capabilities of Azure DevOps.

1. **Code Scanning with CodeQL**: Code scanning is also a pipeline-based scanning tool where results are aggregated per repository.
2. **Secret Scanning**: Secret scanning push protection and repository scanning are automatically enabled when you turn on Advanced Security. You can enable or disable secret push protection from the repository settings page.
3. **Dependency scanning**: Dependency scanning is a pipeline-based scanning tool. Results are aggregated per repository. It's recommended that you add the dependency scanning task to all the pipelines you'd like to be scanned.

## Benefits of Integration

- **Enhanced Security**: By integrating GHAS with ADO, you can catch vulnerabilities early in the development process and ensure that your code is secure before it is deployed.
- **Automated Workflows**: Automate security checks and balances within your CI/CD pipeline to reduce manual effort and improve efficiency.
